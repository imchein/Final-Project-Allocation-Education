There are too many nodes in the database. The creation of the relationship between all the nodes of the Database can get to be too heavy.  For this reason we will upload the different tables used in the study for the following only for the following five countries: 

1. Afghanistan
2. Algeria
3. Angola
4. Argentina
5. Armenia
The different tables for the subset of the database are uploaded in Neo4jDatabase. 

Before running the code in Neo4j, you need to upload the csv files into the program. Open the Neo4j Desktop App and click on the three dots on the upper right corner of the Database. Click on `Manage`. Then, click on the down arrow of `Open Folder` and then click on `Import`. Copy all the csv files to that Folder.

Once you have all the tables on the `Import` folder, you can run the code from the document `AllocationEducationGraphDatabase` to get the Graph Database.

If instead of making just a subset of the Data, you want to get all the Nodes from the Database, the different tables as csv files are uploaded in the `CSVtables` folder. The process would be the same but you would need to upload these tables on the `Import` table.
